    Thank you for signing up! Keep your eyes peeled for an email from
    an educator looking for your unique skills and experiences. If you
    don't hear anything for a while, don't despair, it just means an
    educator has not signed up yet who is quite the right match. You
    are part of something that is just beginning to grow. As this is a
    "BETA test" of CommunityShare, we ask for your patience and
    feedback as we smooth out any bumps in the road.
