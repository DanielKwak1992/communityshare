      What's a Community Partner?
    </h4>

  <div class="modal-body">

    <p>
      <strong>Community partners</strong> include individuals, businesses,
      nonprofit organizations, and academics (staff/students) in higher
      education who are excited to share their skills, experiences and passions
      with teachers and students in schools and out-of-school settings. They
      might have developed their skills and experiences through their work,
      schooling, hobbies, or the paths of life. They could be an elder who
      knows local neighborhood history, a faculty member or grad student at the
      UA, a chef at a restaurant, or a parent who is also an engineer at a
      local engineering firm.

      If you wear dual hats -- working sometimes as a teacher and other times
      serving as a community partner -- we encourage you to make one profile as
      a teacher and another as a community partner. For example, you might
      currently teach 8th grade Art but in "your previous life" you worked as a
      graphic designer and are willing to share your graphic design expertise
      with others. Ok, maybe you won't sleep, butâ€¦.
