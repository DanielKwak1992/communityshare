      <strong>Community partners</strong> include individuals,
      businesses, nonprofit organizations, and higher education
      institutions who are excited to share their skills, experiences
      and passions with teachers and students in schools and
      out-of-school settings. They might have developed their skills
      and experiences through their work, schooling, hobbies, or the
      paths of life. They could be an elder who knows local
      neighborhood history, a faculty member or grad student at the
      UA, a chef at a restaurant, or a parent who is also an engineer
      at a local engineering firm.

      <strong>Educators</strong> are school teachers and people who
      teach/mentor youth in informal learning environments
      (e.g. afterschool programs, homeschooling) who are looking for
      community partners and experts to work with their students.

      If you wear dual hats -- working sometimes are an educator and
      other times serving a community partner -- we encourage you to
      make one profile as an educator and another as a community
      partner. For example, you might currently teach 8th grade Art
      but in "your previous life" you worked as a graphic designer and
      are willing to share your graphic design expertise with
      others. Ok, maybe you won't sleep, butâ€¦.
